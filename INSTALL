NAME
    SquidGuard Manager - Web GUI for SquidGuard and SquidClamav
    administration

DESCRIPTION
    SquidGuard Manager is a Perl CGI Web GUI for squidGuard and SquidClamav
    administration. It allows full management of SquidGuard blocklist and
    ACLs. You can also manage graphicaly your SquidClamav configuration.

    This program supports all configuration directives of SquidGuard and
    SquidClamav without intrusive modification, i-e you can still edit the
    configuration files by hand before and after using SquidGuard Manager.

REQUIREMENT
    SquidGuard Manager may run on any Unix like OS with any modern Perl
    installation using the perl CGI module. It must be run on a proxy server
    hosting squidGuard.

    You need to run this CGI script using Apache HTTP server. And the httpd
    daemon must be run as uid and gid holding SquidGuard (most of the time
    this is squid cache effective user/group). This is to allow SquidGuard
    Manager to read and write into the configuration files to manage
    blocklists and acls. If you use SquidClamav, it must be run under the
    same user too.

    SquidGuard Manager uses some system commands to manage blocklists and
    log files. Your system must have the following binaries installed: diff,
    grep, find, rm and tail.

INSTALLATION
    To install SquidGuard Manager you must be able to gain root privilege so
    that installer script can put files with appropriate permission.

  Prepare your system
    SquidGuard Manager need to have read/write access onto SquidGuard
    configuration file and the dbhome directory. It must also have read
    rights onto the log file. If you use the SquidClamav Manager GUI it also
    need read/write access on the squidclamav.conf file as well as the log
    file.

    For that reason SquidGuard Manager must be run as the user under which
    SquidGuard and SquidClamav are run. Most of the time this is the Squid
    cache effective user.

            chown -R squid:squid /usr/local/squidGuard
    or
            chown -R squid:squid /etc/squidguard.conf /var/lib/squidguard

    To allow httpd to run squidguardmgr.cgi as appropriate user/group you
    must edit your httpd.conf file and set the User and Group directives to
    the user and group running Squid.

    After configuration changes squid ought to be 'reconfigure'd, in other
    words quick-restarted. SquidGuard Manager Web GUI does it by using a
    'setuid root'ed wrapper. If your system doesn't support the feature
    unfortunately, you may need to do that by hand.

    IMPORTANT: SquidGuard Manager doesn't support symbolic links in the
    SquidGuard dbhome directory. If it is your case, you need to remove
    those symbolic links and modify your squidguard.conf file so that points
    the real files and directories.

  Automatic installation
    Execute the install script and answer to some questions it ask:

            $ perl Makefile.PL
            $ make
            $ su
            # make install

    By default it will install all files into /var/www/squidguardmgr/ and
    show you a configuration sample that should be included in your
    httpd.conf. Also, you can find some Apache configuration samples in
    contrib/ directory of the SquidGuard Manager source repository. Once you
    have done, restart httpd server and take a look at
    http://my.proxy.dom/squidguardmgr/ or
    http://my.proxy.dom:port/squidguardmgr/

    You can fully customize this installation by passing the following
    variables to Makefile.PL:

            CONFFILE => Absolute path to the SquidGuard configuration file
            DBHOME => Absolute path to the SquidGuard DB directory
            LOGDIR => Absolute path to the SquidGuard log directory
            WWWDIR => Absolute path to the SquidGuard Manager base installation directory
            CGIDIR => Relative path from WWWDIR to install CGI script. Default equals WWWDIR
            HTMLDIR =>  Relative path from WWWDIR to install css, js and image files. Default equals WWWDIR
            LANGDIR => Translation language to use (en_US or fr_FR). Default: en_USœ
            BASEURL => Path part of the base url to access SquidGuard Manager Web GUI. Default: /squidguardmgr
            SQUIDUSR => User running Squid
            SQUIDGRP => Group running Squid
            SQUIDCLAMAV => Absolute path to the squidclamav binary (v5.x only)
            CICAP_SOCKET => c-icap server control socket (v6.x only)
            SQUIDCLAMAVCONF => Absolute path to squidclamav.conf file

    For packaging there's two more configuration variables:

            DESTDIR => Directory prefix wher install will be done
            QUIET => Do not display the post install message

    Example:

            perl Makefile.PL \
            CONFFILE=/usr/local/etc/squidguard.conf \
            DBHOME=/usr/local/squidguard/db \
            LOGDIR=/usr/local/logs/squidguard \
            WWWDIR=/usr/local/apache CGIDIR=cgi-bin/admin HTMLDIR=htdocs/admin \
            LANGDIR=fr_FR BASEURL=/admin SQUIDUSR=squid SQUIDGRP=squid \
            SQUIDCLAMAV=/usr/local/bin/squidclamav \
            SQUIDCLAMAVCONF=/etc/squidclamav.conf

            make && make install

    This will install SquidGuard Manager CGI squidguardmgr.cgi,
    squidguardmgr.conf, squid_wrapper and all language files under
    /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/admin/. All SquidGuard Manager css, js and
    images files will be copied under the directory
    /usr/local/apache/htdocs/admin/. Squidguard Manager will expect to find
    the SquidGuard configuration file at /usr/local/etc/squidguard.conf and
    the log and SquidGuard databases respectively at
    /usr/local/logs/squidguard and /usr/local/squidguard/db. All the
    installed files will be owned by user squid and group squid. The squid
    wrapper (use to reconfigure squid after change) will be setuid root.

  Manual installation
    Copy all files from the cgi-bin repository into the CGI script directory
    of your choice. Check that squidguardmgr.cgi can be executable by your
    Apache server and chown the entire directory to the user and group
    running httpd.

    Copy all files from the htdocs repository into your DocumentRoot
    directory or any other subdirectory and check that they can be read by
    your httpd server.

    Edit the squidguardmgr.conf file into your cgi directory and check that
    all paths conforms to your installation.

    If you want to be able to reload Squid redirector from the GUI interface
    after your SquidGuard and/or SquidClamav modification, you must compile
    and install the squid_wrapper with suid root into the squidguardmgr.cgi
    directory.

    Before compilation you may need to edit squid_wrapper.c and change the
    SQUID_BINARY definition to point correctly to your squid binary.

    Then as root:

            cd squid_wrapper/
            cc -o /path/squidguardmgr/cgi/squid_wrapper squid_wrapper.c
            chown root.root /path/squidguardmgr/cgi/squid_wrapper
            chmod u+s /path/squidguardmgr/cgi/squid_wrapper
